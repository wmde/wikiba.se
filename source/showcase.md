## Showcase

**Who uses Wikibase?** Any organization can use it to manage and open up their structured data, and many do&mdash;in particular, data-minded [GLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAM_(industry_sector)) organizations across the world. Here's a sampling of them and their projects using Wikibase. 

### Libraries

Libraries frequently find Wikibase well suited to their requirements: it provides librarians with powerful collaboration tools with no need for prior in-depth knowledge of linked open data principles. 

- [The German National Library](https://blog.wikimedia.de/2019/05/09/new-testing-ground-for-wikibase-a-federal-agency-goes-on-an-expedition-in-the-wiki-universe/)'s work on the [Integrated Authority File](https://www.dnb.de/EN/Professionell/Standardisierung/GND/gnd_node.html;jsessionid=E61B2D7E0B50C9B6FCF9A77BD3DE79B3.internet552#doc147904bodyText1)
- [The French National Library](https://www.transition-bibliographique.fr/fne/french-national-entities-file/)'s National Entities File (FNE)
- Global library cooperative [OCLC](https://www.oclc.org)'s [Project Passage](https://www.oclc.org/research/publications/2019/oclcresearch-creating-library-linked-data-with-wikibase-project-passage.html)

### Collections

Wikibase offers the greenfield conditions often needed by collections with large bodies of custom data in order to create an accurate representation of the unique information in their hands.

- [Rhizome](https://rhizome.org/about/), a collection of born-digital art ([blog entry](https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2018/09/06/rhizome-wikibase/))
- [Linked Jazz](https://linkedjazz.org/), describing the oral history of jazz using linked data

### Research

We see universities and research groups using Wikibase for its flexibility and ease in collaboration, and we see it helping them bring fascinating bodies of information to light. 

- Factgrid's [database for historians](https://blog.factgrid.de/welcome), which includes their project [The Illuminati Files](https://blog.factgrid.de/archives/category/projects/the-illuminati-files-online) ([blog entry](https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2018/08/30/wikibase-illuminati-history/))
- Michigan State University's [Enslaved](https://enslaved.org/) project

### Science

Perhaps no subset of Wikibase's usership leaps as readily to one's mind as the scientific community: huge amounts of raw data, multiple collaborators, every project's data structure wildly different and ripe for federation. 

- [GeneWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Molecular_Biology/Genetics/Gene_Wiki), using community collaborating to annotate the function of genes and proteins
- [ABCD](https://biss.pensoft.net/article/37212/), a project by the [TDWG](https://www.tdwg.org/) on [biodiversity information standards](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/) 

<hr>

There also exists a [voluntary registry](https://wikibase-registry.wmflabs.org/wiki/Main_Page) containing many more sites, not to mention a [community user group](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikibase_Community_User_Group/Reports/2018).
